# Simulating the Impact of Green Space Exposure on Cardiometabolic Biomarkers in a Diverse Population Living in San Diego, California: A G-Computation Application
# G-Computation Analysis

This repository hosts the codes and documentation for projects related to G-computation. Blood glucose level is provided as the example in these codes. Codes were identical for the other biomarkers (simply replaced the outcome to the specific biomarker of interest). 

Codes listed 1-7 were utilized for analysis (Codes 1-6 provided in R, Code 7 provided in Stata). 
Code #1 provides the g-computation simulation across the entire population. 
Codes #2-#5 provide the g-computation simulations assessing for effect modification (by sex, ethnicity, income, and age, respectively).
Code #6 appends the data across the total population and effect modifiers.
Code #7 provides the heterogeneity tests performed on the appended dataset as well as the creation of the supplemental tables.
